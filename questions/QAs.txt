list_tuples_dicts.py

hello, my name is abc. I am good, but this is better.
>>better, is this but good. am I abc, is name my hello.

3. reverse a string and move only characters(in similar fashion as above) ==>line_string_reversal.py

4. how do list/tuples store elements inside them? (memory allocation. How does list know to while accessing 100th index that 99th index is of which type so that it can move
appropriate bytes in that case -- memory allocation )

5. linkedlist implement ==> p1/week2/linkedlist.py

6. queue implement using stack ==>  queue_using_stack.py

7. bitmasking and bitwise operators code ==> bitwise_operators.py

  7.a. nibbles (reverse upper nibble with lower nibble) (binary_operations.py)
